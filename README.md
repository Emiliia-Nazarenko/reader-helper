# Reader Helpler

This program is for reding books and texts. After loading the text, it is divided into words. 

- If you do not know the word - you can enter its translation and save.  
- If you know the word - you can delete it.  
At the end of the program excecution, you can download a file with the words  
and their translations.  

Only for .txt files.

## 1. Uploading of the text for translation. 
File format: .txt
You can see that in the left text box there is a text to be translated, and in the right text box there is a list of words from this text, sorted alphabetically.
And the first word from the list immediately appears in the "Next word" field.

## 2. As a next step, you have two options:
- Modify the word list in the right text field manually using the keyboard and download the .txt file with the word list.
+ Modify the word list in the right text field by programm. 
  - Delete - Remove the word from the list. 
  - Save - Save the word and its translation, ex. "dog - собака".
  - Ramaining words - Shows list of words that have not yet been translated.
  - Translated words - Shows list of words that have already been translated.
 
 ## 3. When you have finished translating words, you can download a .txt file with a list of translated words.
